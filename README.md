# Bootcamp #1: Asteroids Clone
This is the first official project of my Corkboard Studio Developer Bootcamp! This is the first of four planned games I will be making to broaden my understanding of my game engine of choice, [GameMaker](https://www.gamemaker.io/) (version 2024.13.xx). I am relatively new to the engine. I was looking for a game engine that would be the appropriate level of power and ease-of-use for my high school students and thought this engine met this criteria. I have used Godot in my classes for the past couple of years and it has been a struggle for my students to use, which prompted me to look for an alternative. Through this self-designed bootcamp, I hope to gain a strong understanding of the workflow and game structure of GameMaker games, so that I will be prepared to teach my students how to use it, as well as begin working on *Of Mice and Tales* after completing this bootcamp. 

For this first project, I'm building a feature-rich clone of the arcade classic, [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)).

While there are many shorter tutorials available, I've chosen to follow the comprehensive 15-part "masterclass" series created by [Justin Zendt](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ4rnkwF3EJh5UQNNLVTlsw6WKjne9iVg&si=94lC_9E1HWN6Ll-5). As a developer new to GameMaker, I didn't want to make just a simple clone. My goal isn't just to learn what to type, but to gain a better understanding of the hows and whys behind the code. After watching a few excerpts from his series, I found his in-depth explanations of engine-specific concepts to be top-notch, and I'm excited to dive deep.

This project will serve as my foundation for top-down movement, object management, and core game loop structure in GameMaker.

Thank you for following along on this first step of the journey!
